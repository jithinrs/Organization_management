Task Description
Objective:
Create a Django application with custom user authentication (login and signup) and organisation management features
 (multiple organisations and their user management).

Requirements:

Models:

User: Custom user model.
Organization: Model representing an organization.

User and Organization Relationship:

If a User's email matches an Organization's email, that User is designated as the admin of that Organization.

When an admin creates a new user, that user is automatically added to the admin's organization.
If a user signs up independently, they should be added to a "global" organization by default.

Views:

Signup Page: Form for new users to sign up.
Login Page: Form for existing users to log in.

Functionalities:

Admin Privileges: Admin users should have the capability to create new users within their organization.
Global Organization: Ensure there is a default "global" organization for users signing up without an existing organization.
